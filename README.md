## Timeware
Just a simple code that would stop a user from running your system for more than X hours. After reaching X hours the script will warn the user for shutting down the system. The system will shutdown itself if the user hadn't did yet. If they reboot the system, the script will ask for a password (default is: *timeware*) It will block the user from running any programs (can be changed in kill.bat) after it has been activated

Read the code for more info. Replace the path's in start.vbs, and kill_tasks.vbs for making the script work. Add the process to kill when locked, following the syntax in kill.bat. Copy the start.vbs file to the STARTUP folder **(script only works on windows)**


> Script has no garanty in working, and is still in development.
